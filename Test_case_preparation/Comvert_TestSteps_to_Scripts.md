<h3>Converting Test Steps to Scripts</h3>

Once the requirements are comprehensively understood, the next step in test case preparation involves converting test steps into executable scripts for automation. This process entails translating manual test cases, which outline step-by-step instructions for validating specific functionalities or scenarios, into automated scripts using suitable testing frameworks and tools. For Amazon web testing automation, popular tools like Selenium WebDriver, Puppeteer, or Cypress can be leveraged to automate interactions with web elements such as buttons, forms, dropdowns, and links. Testers need to meticulously map each test step to the corresponding automation script, considering factors such as data inputs, expected outcomes, error handling, and assertions. Additionally, incorporating reusable functions, parameterization, and modularization techniques enhances the maintainability and scalability of automated test scripts. By converting test steps to scripts, testers streamline the testing process, reduce manual effort, and facilitate continuous integration and regression testing, thereby accelerating the feedback loop and ensuring the reliability and robustness of the Amazon web application or website.
