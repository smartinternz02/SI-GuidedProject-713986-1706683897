<h3>Understanding Requirements</h3>

Before proceeding with test case preparation, a thorough understanding of the requirements is essential. This involves dissecting the functional and non-functional specifications provided for the software or system under test. In the context of Amazon web testing automation, it's imperative to comprehend the intricacies of the various features, functionalities, and user workflows present on the Amazon website or application. This includes understanding how users interact with the platform, the expected behavior of different components, and any performance, security, or compatibility requirements. Collaborating closely with stakeholders, such as product managers, developers, and UX designers, helps clarify ambiguities, validate assumptions, and ensure alignment between testing objectives and business goals. By establishing a clear understanding of requirements upfront, testers can create accurate and effective test cases that address the core functionalities and edge cases of the Amazon web ecosystem, ultimately contributing to the delivery of a high-quality, user-centric product.
