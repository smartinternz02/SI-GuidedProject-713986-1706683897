<h3>Git integration</h3>

The integration of Katalon Studio with Git enables test automation teams to leverage the robust version control capabilities offered by Git for managing test scripts, test data, and project configurations efficiently. With Git integration, testers can seamlessly commit changes, create branches, merge code, and resolve conflicts directly from within the Katalon Studio IDE. This tight integration streamlines collaboration, fosters transparency, and facilitates code reviews among team members, thereby enhancing the overall quality and reliability of test automation projects. Additionally, Git integration empowers testers to track the history of changes, revert to previous versions if needed, and maintain a centralized repository of test assets, ensuring consistency and traceability across different iterations of the project lifecycle.
