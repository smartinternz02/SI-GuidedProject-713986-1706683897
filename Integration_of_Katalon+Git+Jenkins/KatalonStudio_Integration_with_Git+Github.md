<h3>integration with Git and GitHub</h3>

Integrating Katalon Studio with Git and GitHub streamlines collaboration and version control for test automation projects. Git serves as a distributed version control system, while GitHub provides a centralized platform for hosting Git repositories and facilitating collaboration among team members. By integrating Katalon Studio with Git and GitHub, testers can easily manage test scripts, test data, and project configurations within a version-controlled environment. This integration enables seamless synchronization of changes, branching, merging, and rollback functionalities, empowering teams to work concurrently on test automation projects with confidence. Testers can leverage Git's features such as commits, branches, and pull requests to track changes, review code, and collaborate effectively, thereby enhancing the traceability, accountability, and maintainability of test assets within the Katalon Studio ecosystem.
