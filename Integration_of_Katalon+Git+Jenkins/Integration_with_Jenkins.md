<h3> Integration With Jenkins</h3>

Integrating Katalon Studio with Jenkins enables the automation of test execution and reporting as part of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipelines. Jenkins is a popular automation server that orchestrates the build, test, and deployment processes, facilitating seamless integration of Katalon Studio test suites into CI/CD workflows. With Jenkins integration, testers can schedule and trigger test executions automatically based on predefined triggers, such as code commits or scheduled intervals. Test results, including pass/fail statuses, logs, and screenshots, can be captured and reported within Jenkins, providing real-time visibility into the health and quality of the application under test. By integrating Katalon Studio with Jenkins, organizations can achieve faster feedback loops, early detection of defects, and improved collaboration between development and QA teams, ultimately accelerating the delivery of high-quality software products.
