<h3>Setup and TearDown</h3>

In the realm of test automation, setup and teardown procedures are fundamental components that ensure the reliability and repeatability of test executions. Setup refers to the preparation phase where the necessary preconditions and configurations are established before the execution of each test case. This may include activities such as initializing the test environment, launching the web browser, logging in to the application, or setting up test data. On the other hand, teardown, also known as cleanup, involves restoring the system to its original state after the test execution completes, regardless of whether the test passes or fails. This phase typically includes actions like logging out from the application, closing browser sessions, or resetting the test environment to its initial state. By meticulously managing setup and teardown procedures, testers ensure that each test case runs in a consistent and isolated environment, minimizing dependencies between tests and facilitating accurate validation of the system's behavior.
